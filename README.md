# About Us
PureFPS is a modpack which attempts to bring modern optimizations to every aspect of the game. No cutting corners. The modpack also does not try and seek to alter the original game's feel or it's mechanics, improving only performance.

# OptiFine Mechanics
PureFPS attempts to recreate OptiFine's mechanics, such as zooming, connected textures, and shaders.

# Built on Quilt
We use the Quilt modloader to bring the functionality of Fabric and the speed of light.

# Open-source Mods
PureFPS commits itself to only using open-source mods, available to the public. If necessary, we will make our own open-source mods as an alternative, if necessary.

#P otato-Mode!
We will also release a version of the modpack for lower-end PCs willing to sacrifice looks for performance.

# Why should I prefer PureFPS?

Besides the aforementioned features, we will also attempt to expand and update the modpack according to new performance enhancing features.

## Much love from the PureFPS dev! <3
